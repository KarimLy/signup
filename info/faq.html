<h1>Signupandmakemoney Frequently Asked Questions:</h1>

<img src="../Assets/faq.gif" align="right" hspace="50" alt="Big, blue question mark laying sideways." title="Get your questions answered here." />

<ol>

	<li><a href="#" name="faq-1">How and where do I begin advertsing my website(s)?</a>

	<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-1"><br />For the sites we recommend to advertise on, visit the <a href="../traffic/">online advertising</a> page.<br /><br /></div></li>

	<li><a href="#" name="faq-2">How does www.signupandmakemoney.com work?</a>

	<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-2"><br />First off, we do not pay you. All the sites are individual sites and they will all pay you individually. You will be paid as an individual contractor. For example, most sites pay you like this: You sign up for FREE, they put $5.00 in your online account for free. You then stay active in the website and reach $20.00 showing you are consistent. The website's minimum earning requirement is $20.00 to earn your first payment. So you can now cash out. Some sites cash you out automatically and send you a check, other sites you will have to request a payout and will be paid most likely by <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/mrb/pal=L8HS43VDY5UMJ" target="_blank">Paypal</a>. The reason the websites give you the signup bonuses is an incentive for you to start and remain to be active with their website so you can continually earn commissions with them for the rest of your life!<br /><br /></div></li>

	<li><a href="#" name="faq-4">What affiliate sites do you recommend joining?</a>

	<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-4"><br />The affiliate sites I recommend joining can be found at the <a href="../affiliate-tips/business-tips/increase-earnings.html">increase earnings</a> page.<br /><br /></div></li>

    <li><a href="#" name="faq-7">Which sign up bonus sites use Alertpay?</a>

   <li><a href="#" name="faq-9">English is very difficult for me, how can I earn money at your site?</a>

    <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-9"><br />Most of the sign up bonus webistes are pretty much the same. Once you sign up with one or two you'll get the hang of it. Most of them will pay you for reading e-mails, clicking on ads, and referrig other free members. <a href="http://translate.google.com/?hl=en#" target="_blank">Google's free translation service</a> can come in handy as well.<br /><br /></div></li>

    <li><a href="#" name="faq-11">I'm new here at Signupandmakemoney, I don't know what to do, please help?</a>

    <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-11"><br />First thing to do is take advantage of the <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/#bonus">free sign up bonus websites</a>. Feel free to join <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/site/affiliates/signup.php#SignupForm">Signupandmakemoney's affiliate program</a> and get paid for referring other free members. Also comment on the <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/blog/">Sign Up and Make Money Blog</a> to get links back to your website. We always recommend to try out the sites listed on this site, but don't invest any money with them unless you can find legit payment proofs. We have a <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/proofs/">payment proof section</a> on the site so you can see which sites have paid us.<br /><br /></div></li>

    <li><a href="#" name="faq-33">I was wondering how you rate the best, ok, and worse. Does worse work but just not pay as much, or is it just not worth time, or is a a scam?</a>

    <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-33"><br />The best, ok, and worse categories are mainly based off personal opinion only in our experience studying these types of websites. If a site is labeled worse, it doesn't mean it's not a good company or a scam, it just means in our opinion, we don't think it has as much potential for success as an OK or best categorized sign up bonus site. We give categories so you can sign up on the good ones first and not waste your time on others for a better experience overall. If we know for a fact that a certain website is a scam we will label it a scam site.<br /><br /></div></li>

    <li><a href="#" name="faq-34">If I know of a website that pays a sign up bonus and isn't on your list can I share it with you and get credit?</a>

    <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-34"><br />We want Signupandmakemoney.com to be the #1 resource for sites that actually pay people to sign up with them so the answer is YES. If you find a paid to sign up site that isn't on the list and we find that it could benefit others, you will get credit by us using your referral link instead of ours. The site will be put in Best, OK, or Not Sure category based on its payout and realistic earning potential. Simply <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/contact/">contact us anytime</a> if you have a site you want to recommend.

    <h2>Signupandmakemoney Affiliate Program Questions:</h2>

	<ol>

    <li><a href="#" name="faq-13">Can you please explain to me how to set up different channels?</a>

	<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-13"><br />We don't think you'll need to do this in order to promote the Signupandmakemoney affiliate program, but if you are interested this is what we found on the PAP website:<br /><br />"this feature allows affiliates to create advertising channels, and watch which channels bring the  best results for the same banner type. For example, you can create channel for AdWords, and channel for normal website. Then you will be able to compare the results of the same text link placed on AdWords, or on your page".<br /><br /></div></li>

    <li><a href="#" name="faq-16">I have registered at your site and signed up with bonus sites, but nothing shows in my account, where are my commissions?</a>

    <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-16"><br />All the sign up bonus sites are independent affiliate sites that have their own individual sign up bonuses and earning options. The Signupandmakemoney Affiliate Program only pays commissions to affilites that refer other free members to this site through their affiliate links. Make sure to read the <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/info/earnings-disclaimer.html">earnings disclaimer</a> for more information on this question.<br /><br /></div></li>

    <li><a href="#" name="faq-17">How do I get my long affiliate link shortened?</a>

    <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-17"><br />You are free to use any link shortening or cloaking service available on the web. There really isn't any real benefit to this though and you will have to accept the risk of the link shortening service's to work properly and not redirect your links elsewhere or their servers going down. It's better to put your affiliate link in a keyword.<br /><br /></div></li>

    <li><a href="#" name="faq-18">I haven't received my introductory e-mail yet, what should I do?</a>

    <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-18"><br />You should receive your confirmation e-mail almost immediately after signing up, after you click on the confirmation link you should receive your log in credential e-mail immediately after that.

You can refer others to the <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/splash.html" title="You will be promoting this sign up bonus newsletter opt-in page.">sign up bonus newsletter</a> or simply <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/site/affiliates/signup.php#SignupForm" title="You will also get an affiliate link to promote this page to build your downline.">refer other affiliates</a> and earn by building a network of affiliates under you.<br /><br /></div></li>

   <li><a href="#" name="faq-21">Where can I find my affiliate URL to refer others to the sign up bonus newsletter?</a>

    <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-25"><br />First off, you will not get paid $2.00 directly to your Paypal account just for signing up. You have to earn another $8.00 on your own first. Payments are made automatically on the 1st of every month.<br /><br /></div></li>

    <li><a href="#" name="faq-26">I just registered with your site and cannot log in, what should I do?</a>

    <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-26"><br />If you can't log into the affiliate program, first try the <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/site/affiliates/login.php#reqpasswd">forgot your password link</a>, if that doesn't work, <a href="mailto:info@signupandmakemoney.com" target="_blank" title="Contact admin and your password can be manually changed to something temporary as well.">contact us right away</a> and we will see what is up with your account and will probably just have to manually update your password for you.<br /><br /></div></li>

    <li><a href="#" name="faq-32">I did a big advertising campaign for my affiliate link, but no impressions or clicks were registered by the system, is their something I'm doing wrong?</a>

    <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-32"><br />Only campaigns (<i>sign up bonus newsletter</i>) are tracked by the affiliate system. Your affiliate link is not tracked. This doesn't mean you can't track it yourself using a third party tracking system.<br /><br /></div></li>
