    <p>The first thing you'll want to do is to keep everything <a href="../affiliate-tips/business-tips/stay-organized.html">organized</a> by <span class="important">opening up a separate e-mail account</span> to sign up with all the paid to sign up sites. Why do this? The reason is because the sites will send you paid to read e-mails that pay you anywhere from 1 to 10 cents per e-mail. It's just easier to have a separate e-mail for all of these e-mails to go to so your personal e-mails don't get cluttered. You can do this with hotmail, yahoo, or AIM, whichever you prefer. Make sure to visit the <a href="faq.html" target="_blank" title="Frequently Asked Questions page.">FAQ page</a> to get more info on making the most out of the <span class="important">signupandmakemoney.com</span> site.</p>

    <h2>Use Microsoft Outlook to stay organized</h2>

    <p>If you have Microsoft Outlook it will be a very helpful tool in checking your e-mails. It is very easy to sync everything and you can delete more e-mails at a time. It is also good for keeping a schedule and staying on top of things.</p>

    <h2>Use Robo Form to organize passwords and fill forms</h2>

    <p>Another good thing to do when signing up with all the sites is to use <a href="http://www.roboform.com/php/land.php?affid=gdc25&amp;frm=frame4" target="_blank" title="Roboform.">Roboform </a>because it <span class="important">fills all your forms</span> for you which saves you a ton of time and it remembers and <span class="important">organizes your passwords</span> for you! A great, free tool to have. I would also recommend using the same user name and password for all the sites so it doesn't get too confusing. Some sites you won't be able to do this, but a majority of them you will. The cool thing about this software is that it is very easy to use and has really good customer service if you have any questions at all.</p>

    <h2>Put all your referral links for the sites in one spot</h2>

    <p>I use Microsoft Excel to organize all my referral links. This is important because a lot of <a href="../traffic/traffic-exchanges.html">traffic sites</a> will ask you for a website link. Instead of having to log into your account every time you need the link it is a lot easier just to go to one organized file and be able to find the link that way. If you are not familiar with Excel you can also you Microsoft Word or just use a simple <span class="important">Notepad file</span> to keep track of all your referral links.</p>

    <h2>Suggestion on how to click through the sites</h2>

    <p>If you are like me and you like to multi-task, then this will be easy for yor, if not, don't worry, it's not as hard as it looks. Most of the sites have timers on the ads you click. You are <span class="important">not required to stare at the ad for the entire length of the ad</span>. Most ads run for about <span class="important">30 seconds</span> each before you are credited for clicking on it. If you have two computers like I do, it is very easy to click on ads with one computer and do an entirely different task on your other computer. I recommend opening up two <a href="../get-paid-to-sites/paid-to-click.html">ptc sites</a> at a time. Click on an ad for both, and then go back to your normal work on your other computer. Just keep repeating this process while you do your normal daily tasks on your computer. </p>

    <p>You can probably make about <span class="important">$2.00 - $3.00/day in about a 5 hour work period</span>, which is you'll click on about <span class="important">200 to 300 ads a day</span>. This would come out to an extra <span class="important">$100.00/mo income for you on average</span>. This is without referring people and while doing your normal computer tasks everyday. In order to make this much money you'll need to be a member of a lot of sites to keep the ads coming in. They are all free, so you have nothing to lose.</p>

    <p>I know most of you don't have two computers to play with or 5 hrs a day of computer time to play with either. If you only have one computer, what I recommend doing is opening up just one ptc site at a time and clicking through the ads while doing your other work. Doing this, you might only get through a <span class="important">50 to 100 ads a day</span> in about a <span class="important">1 to 2 hour time period</span>. This is still a good monthly income of around <span class="important">$30.00/mo</span>. The key is to be consistent and do a little bit everyday. Remember, the more people you refer, the faster the money will come rolling in. </p>

    <h2>How the sites pay you</h2>

    <p>A lot of people are asking me how these sites pay you to sign up. First off, <span class="important">I do not pay you</span>. All the sites are individual sites and they will all pay you <span class="important">individually</span>. You will be paid as an individual contractor. For example, most sites pay you like this: You sign up for FREE, they put $5.00 in your <span class="important">online account for free</span>. You then stay active in the website and reach $20.00 showing you are consistent. The website's minimum earning requirement is $20.00 to earn your first payment. So you can now cash out. Some sites cash you out automatically and send you a check, other sites you will have to request a payout and will be paid most likely by <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/mrb/pal=L8HS43VDY5UMJ" target="_blank">Paypal</a>.</p>

    <p>The reason the websites give you the <a href="../blog/tag/free-to-join/">sign up bonuses</a> is an incentive for you to start and remain to be active with their website so you can continually earn commissions with them for the rest of your life! If you are interested in getting instant money for signing up with Companies, I've made a separate webpage for <a href="../bonus/fast-sign-up-bonus-sites.html">fast sign up bonuses</a>.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of what I am earning with some of the sites so you get a better understanding of the earning potential you can make!!</p> 

    <ul>

      <li><a href="../proofs/signup-bonus/sendearnings-payment-proof.html" title="Join Send Earnings.">Send Earnings</a> - they have paid me <span class="important">5 times</span> and I've earned <span class="important">$500</span> with them!</li>

      <li><a href="../proofs/signup-bonus/bux.to-payment-proof.html" title="Join Bux.to.">Bux.to</a> - they have paid me <span class="important">$276 so far</span>, I have over <span class="important">$4,000 in my account</span> and my next payment will be <span class="important">$2,800</span>!</li>

      <li><a href="../proofs/signup-bonus/inboxdollars-payment-proof.html" title="Join Inboxdollars.">Inbox Dollars</a> - they have sent me a check for <span class="important">over $80.00</span> so far!</li>

      <li><a href="../proofs/signup-bonus/hits4pay-payment-proof.html" title="Join Hits4pay.">Hits 4 Pay</a> - they have <span class="important">paid me 4 times</span> so far and I am now making over <span class="important">$30.00/mo</span> with them!</li>

    </ul>

    <p>There are some examples for you. All the sites are free to sign up with, so I recommend taking advantage of all of them because they don't cost you a single dime. Sign up on them all and try them out and pick out the ones you like the best. </p>
