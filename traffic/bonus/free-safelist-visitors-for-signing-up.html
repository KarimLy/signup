<p>These Safelists actually give you <span class="important_money">free advertising credits</span> when you sign up with them. If you are looking to get some nice free traffic to your <a href="../../affiliate-tips/business-tips/increase-earnings.html">affiliate sites</a>, this is a great way to get started. </p>

<p>Be prepared to receive a lot of e-mails if you sign up with these Companies. I would recommend getting a separate e-mail account before signing up with the Safelists. Trust me when I say you will be getting a lot of e-mails from these Safelists. I also recommend that you only take advantage of the free traffic, don't purchase advertising with these sites as the free traffic is as good as it gets.</p>

<p>Make sure to download <a href="http://www.roboform.com/php/land.php?affid=gdc25&amp;frm=frame4" target="_blank" title="Roboform.">RoboForm</a>, this will make it very easy to register with all the Companies!</p>
