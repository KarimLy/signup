    <p>I think we've all been in a situation where we'd like to say, &quot;I'm going to call a lawyer.&quot; Sometimes we even go so far as to say the words - but many times, the call is never actually made. Why? Maybe it's a fear of the unknown or the potential cost. Did you know that calling a lawyer doesn't have to be just something you say you're going to do? It can become something you do without having to worry about the cost or who to call. </p>
    <p>As an independent associate with Legal Shield, I would like to make sure all your questions are answered. </p>

    <p>~~NAME~~,</p>
    <p>If you were to ask a law firm to prepare and review a legal document for you, the cost could be substantial. In fact, on average, one hour of a lawyer's time may cost more than the iPlan annual membership fee*! </p>
    <p>&quot;Bargain&quot; internet forms and do-it-yourself kits suggest that you consult with a lawyer before executing the document you've purchased. With the Legal Shield you get legal review by your provider law firm of contracts and documents 10 pages or less on which you are a contracting party. </p>
