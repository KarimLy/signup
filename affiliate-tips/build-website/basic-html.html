<h1>HTML basics</h1>

<img src="../../Assets/html-basics.jpg" alt="A whole bunch of html tags." title="A whole bunch of HTML tags." style="padding-left:15px;" align="right" width="400" height="300" />

    <p>HTML is basically a programming language. Everything is made with tags. You will always have an opening tag <span class="important_money">&lt;h1&gt;</span> and a closing tag <span class="important_money">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>. The information on this page is a basic overview, take a look at the w3c school's <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank" title="Tutorial on some basic HTML from w3schools.">tutorial on basic HTML</a> to get a more in depth look.</p>

    <h2>How a page is structured</h2>

      <p>Here is what a basic page structure is made of:</p>

      <p class="important_money">&lt;html&gt;<br />

&lt;head&gt;<br />

&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;<br />

&lt;/head&gt;<br />

&lt;body&gt;<br />

&lt;/body&gt;<br />

&lt;/html&gt;</p>

      <h2>How to link pages</h2>

      <p>To link a contact us page to your index.html page (also known as your home page), you would put this in the html code <span class="important_money">&lt;a href=&quot;contact_us.html&quot;&gt;Contact Us&lt;/a&gt;</span> if you wanted that page to open in a new window you would add <span class="important_money">target=&quot;_blank&quot;</span> so it would look like this <span class="important_money">&lt;a href=&quot;contact_us.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Contact Us&lt;/a&gt;</span>.</p>

      <h2>How to add website affiliate links</h2>

      <p>To add a website link to your site the code looks like this: <span class="important_money">&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.signupandmakemoney.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.signupandmakemoney.com&lt;/a&gt;</span> Whenever adding a link it is always important to include <span class="important_money">http://</span> so the web link will work properly. </p>

      <h2>How to add a picture</h2>

      <p>To add a picture to your site and center it the code would look like this: <span class="important_money">&lt;img src=&quot;cat.jpg&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;</span>. The paragraph tag is <span class="important_money">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span> to bold text is <span class="important_money">&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</span> to put a break in the text (like hitting the enter button on keyboard) you would use <span class="important_money">&lt;br /&gt;</span> tag.</p>

    <h2>How to view coding from browsers</h2>

      <p>There are some examples of using html coding. What I recommend you do while you build your website with <span class="important_money">My Free Website Builder</span> is to hit the source tab from normal view so you can actually see what the html code looks like behind the scenes.</p>

      <h2>How to add an affiliate banner to your site</h2>

      <p>When adding an <a href="../business-tips/increase-earnings.html" title="See some free affiliate sites you can join.">affiliate</a> banner to your website, know that you cannot add it in plain view. You must add the banner in html view. This is because the plain view is <span class="important_money">WYSIWYG</span> (What You See Is What You Get) HTML view on the other hand is where all coding should be placed. Most web design software has a split view so you can see your HTML code and the plain view at the same time. If you are not familiar with HTML, this will help you know where you are placing the banner in plain view. </p>

    <h2>Contact me if you have any questions</h2>

      <p>If you are interested in continuing to learn more about html I would recommend either getting a book on html or taking a college class.  If you have questions about html or you are having trouble getting something to look the way you want on your site, don't hesitate to <a href="../../contact/" target="_blank" title="Contact Greg London.">contact me</a> anytime!</p>
