<p>One of the first things your are going to want to do to your website if you want to make money online is to monetize it. I made a page dedicated to showing you how to <a href="increase-earnings.html">increase earnings</a> from your website. You want to join Affiliate Networks that pay you per lead, not per sale. This will greatly increase you income online. You'll also want to take advantage of inline banner and text advertising.</p>

<p>An important aspect of any <a href="../../more-income/business-opportunities.html">home based business</a> is the necessity of <a href="stay-organized.html">staying organized</a> and keeping track of income and expenses. You need to know what you can and can't write off as business expenses. You'll also want to set up an area in your home as your designated work space. These things will help you succeed in your online business.</p>
