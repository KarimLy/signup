<h1>Increase your income with a home-based business</h1>

    <p>The first thing I want to cover for increasing your revenue is going over the <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/blog/2009/03/tax-benefits-of-a-home-based-business/">tax benefits you get for owning your own online business</a>. This is mainly for <span class="important_money">United States Citizens only</span>. I am not a tax specialist or advisor, but I do want to make sure you know what you can deduct so every dollar you make is fully yours. (Consult a tax specialist for exact deductions and counsel). <span class="comment"><a href="javascript: taxbenefits()" title="See comments from others about the tax benefits of owning your own home-based business and add your own.">Comments on tax benefits of a home-based business</a>.</span></p>

    <p>So this is how it works in a nutshell, you spend <span class="important_money">$30.00 in advertising</span> at <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/blog/2009/01/clixsense-as-an-advertising-option-online/">Clixsense</a> to advertise a certain website where you will get <span class="important">$10.00 for every free person you sign up</span>. After your 3,000 clicks in advertising has finished you ended up referring 6 people! You made $60.00, that's great! But you spent $30.00 in advertising to get those 6 people. So you can write off the $30.00 in advertising against the $60.00 in profit. So at the end <span class="important_money">only $30.00 will be taxable income</span>.</p>

    <p>So let's quickly go over what else you can <span class="important_money">write off</span> against the income you make online:</p>

    <ul>

      <li><span class="important_money">Communication expenses</span> - your phone to call prospects whether it is a home phone or a <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/blog/2009/05/get-a-commission-on-the-next-cell-phone-you-buy-with-tmi-wireless/">cell phone</a> - your internet connection bill, faxing fees. If you use a 1-800 phone number, it can be written off. </li>

      <li><span class="important_money">Business meals/entertainment</span> - if you take your prospect to a restaurant to sell your product to them and buy yourself and them coffee, up to 50% of that can be a write off. If you host a party for your clients and pay for everything, up to 50% of that can be written off.</li>

      <li><span class="important_money">Home office repair</span> - you should designate one room in your house to be your home office (whatever the square footage of that room to the rest of your house can be deducted). If you fix something in your actual home office it is a 100% deductible. If you paint your house and your home office is 10% of your entire home - 10% of your painting cost can be written off.</li>

      <li><span class="important_money">Travel expenses</span> - you drive somewhere to meet a prospect, keep track of your mileage. You have to pay $3.00 toll to get somewhere to meet your prospect or you have to pay for parking to meet your prospect. This is a business travel expense.</li>

      <li><span class="important_money">Professional services/fees</span> - you have to get your taxes done every year. You pay a CPA to do this and it costs you $200, which can be written off against your income. Let's say you pay a bank fee to get your online income sent to you. That can be written off even if it is only a 45 cent fee. </li>

      <li><span class="important_money">Business education</span> - if you take a class online to learn about <a href="../../">making money online</a> and pay $20, it can be written off. If you buy a book on <a href="../advertising/">online marketing</a> and it costs $15.00, this can be written off. </li>

      <li><span class="important_money">Advertising expenses</span> - You spend $19.10 for 1,000 clicks with <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/blog/2009/01/my-experience-with-buxto/">Bux.to</a>, this can be written off. You pay for an ad in a magazine or newspaper, this can be written off. Your auto responder with <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/blog/2009/03/the-difference-between-get-response-and-aweber/">Get Response</a> can be written off because you need it to advertise your business. </li>

      <li><span class="important_money">Utility expenses</span> - Once again this will be whatever the percentage of your home office square footage is to the rest of your home. It includes your, security system, electricity, sewage, gas, water, and waste management bills. For example, if you pay $30.00/mo for your home security system, $3.00 of that can be written off if your home office equals 10% of your home.</li>

      <li><span class="important_money">Office expenses</span> - this includes: paper, ink, pens, pencils, printer, scanner, etc.. Whatever you need for office supplies to run your business smoothly!</li>

      <li><span class="important_money">Membership expenses</span> - For example, I am a member of Global NPN, it costs me $10.75/mo to be an affiliate with them. I can actually write that off as an expense. If I wasn't a paying member I could not make money with this Company</li>

      <li><span class="important_money">Postage expenses</span> - you need to mail an application to a prospect, this cost you money, it is a business expense. You need to send materials to a client of yours, it is a write off.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Setting up Google Adsense and Adbrite campaigns</h2>

    <p>Adding <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense" target="_blank">Google Adsense</a> to your website can also increase revenue from your website. The way Google Adsense works is Advertisers pay Google to get targeted hits to the websites they are advertising. Google uses your website as real estate online to be able to post those ads on your site. So let's say your site gets over an average of 1000 hits a day, out of those hits 10 people click on the Google ads on your site. Google will then compensate you for those clicks, whether or not a sale was made. This is the easiest money you'll ever make!</p>

    <h2>Get over $1,000 in free signup bonuses and over 1 million in free visitors</h2>

    <p>Here is my main <a href="../../">sign up bonus page</a> which was specifically designed to help you make free money online.
