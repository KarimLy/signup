    <p>This section was made as a tool to help my <a href="../traffic/downline-builders.html">downlines succeed online</a>. Their is a lot of valuable resources to take advantage of on this site!  This section is mainly an <span class="important_money">educational tool</span>. I don't want you to have to learn everything from scratch like I did. I'm going to go ahead and <span class="important_money">teach you everything I know</span> so you can just <span class="important_money">duplicate</span> what I do and succeed online without as much trial and error!</p>

    <p>I like to keep things straight and to the point. So don't expect any long explanations on this site from me. I'm going to cover as much as I can without over doing anything. If you read over something and need more explanation or help setting it up, <a href="../contact/" title="Contact Greg London anytime.">contact me anytime</a>. Believe it or not, I am generally a shy person and don't like to cold call people or call people at all because of the family I was raised in. So if I can be successful online doing this stuff, anybody can!</p>

    <p>You can use this section as a <span class="important_money">reference for all the people you refer</span> as well so that way you will not have to spend as much time in training the people you refer. This is especially important when the person you refer is in another country and it is hard to get a hold of them. Other uses for the site are to learn <a href="build-website/">how to build your own website</a>, <a href="advertising/">how to advertise your site</a>, <a href="business-tips/increase-earnings.html">how to increase income from your site</a> once it is finished, and <a href="business-tips/stay-organized.html">how to stay organized</a> with your online ventures.</p>

    <p>On top of learning about the above <a href="../more-income/business-opportunities.html">business opportunities</a>, you'll get some <a href="../traffic/">free traffic</a> and <a href="../">sign up bonuses</a>. Don't forget the knowledge to continue your online business for years to come.I hope these online business affiliate tips help you succeed online just as they have helped me succeed online.</p>
