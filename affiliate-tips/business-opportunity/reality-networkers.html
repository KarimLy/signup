      <p><a href="http://www.reality-networkers.com/marketingsecret6.php?refid=1502500" target="_blank" title="Join Reality-Networkers.">Reality-Networkers</a> is a <span class="important_money">matrix</span> type business opportunity where all you have to do to succeed is just <span class="important_money">refer 5 paid members</span>. Once you have accomplished referring 5 people, then your goal is to help everyone below you to refer just 5 paid members each. That is why I like this company so much. You, as an upline member, don't get paid unless the people below you are get paid referrals into the business. So naturally you are going to want to do everything you can to help the people below you succeed. <span class="comment"><a href="javascript: realitynetworkers()" title="See comments from others about Reality-Networkers and add your own.">Comments on Reality-Networkers</a>.</span></p>
