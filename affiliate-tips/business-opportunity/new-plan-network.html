<h1>Global NPN Success</h1>
<img src="../../Assets/business-opportunity/globalnpn.com-the-new-plan-network.png" alt="Global NPN Logo." title="The Global NPN logo." style="padding-left:15px;" align="right" />
    <p>The thing I recommend most to be successful with <a href="http://globalnpn.com/?id=56437" target="_blank" title="Join Global NPN.">Global NPN</a> is to take full advantage of the <span class="important_money">ecertificates</span>. This gives someone you refer a <a href="mailto:info@signupandmakemoney.com?subject=I want a 30 day free trial with Global NPN, please email me the 30 day trial code." target="_blank" title="Get a 30 day free trial to try Global NPN out.">30 day trial to try Global NPN out</a>. During that 30 day trial they can cancel at anytime. If they go one day over the trial they will be charged for the second month of service. The reason this works so well is because you buy a $10.75 ecertificate and as soon as someone uses the certificate you make half of that back as a commission. So the ecertificates only cost $5.00 each and if they stay a second month it didn't cost you anything and if they stay forever because they enjoy the <a href="../advertising/">marketing tools</a> and the <a href="../../more-income/business-opportunities.html">business opportunity</a> than it was definitely worth it! NPN definitely pays its members, check out a <a href="javascript: globalnpnproof()" title="A Global NPN proof of payment.">Global NPN payment proof</a> of mine. <span class="comment"><a href="javascript: globalnpnexplained()" title="See comments from others about Global NPN and add your own.">Comments on Global NPN</a>.</span></p>
    <h2>How to log into NPN</h2>
      <p>You can purchase ecertificates from your <a href="http://thenpn.biz/members/" target="_blank" title="Global NPN back office.">back office</a> once you log in.</p>
    <p>The three biggest things I would take advantage of concerning the tools of Global NPN are the autoresponders and the <span class="important_money">link trackers</span>. You get <span class="important_money">10 autoresponders</span> and <span class="important_money">5 link trackers</span> and are able to put up <span class="important_money">3 banners</span> that rotate within the entire NPN network of money making prospects. </p><p><script type="text/javascript"><!--

    <h2>Global NPN Autoresponders</h2>
    <p>I have made <a href="../advertising/npn-autoresponders.html" title="Global NPN pre-written autoresponders that you can copy and paste to help promote your new business.">Global NPN pre-written autoresponders that you can copy</a> and change to make your own to help you get started. It is very important to put your new prospects into an autoresponder right away because this keeps them exposed to your business!</p>
    <p>When you get leads with NPN, a phone number is never given. NPN was meant to be run <span class="important_money">completely online</span>. So make sure your autoresponders do a good job of persuading the prospect to upgrade. A great thing to let your prospects know is that if you <span class="important_money">personally refer only 2 members, your NPN membership will be paid for</span>. That is all it takes to break even, get one more sign up and you are in profit!</p>
    <h2>How to advertise NPN</h2>
    <p>Advertising Global NPN is easy. Especially since the company's products are advertising products. You can use their link trackers, autoresponders, lead blasters, banner rotators, link rotators, etc... Not only to advertise your NPN business, but also to promote any other thing you are involved in.
