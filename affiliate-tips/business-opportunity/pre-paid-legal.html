    <p>Being successful in <a href="http://coverthefamily.info/" target="_blank" title="Join Legal Shield.">Legal Shield</a> as an <span class="important_money">Independent Associate</span> is just a little bit different than being successful in <a href="http://globalnpn.com/?id=56437" target="_blank" title="Join Global NPN">Global NPN</a>  because this business is generally not done completely online and is only based in the United States and Canada. <span class="comment"><a href="javascript: prepaidlegal()" title="See comments from others about Legal Shield and add your own.">Comments on Legal Shield</a>.</span></p>
    <h2>Using PPC Search Marketing to get prospects</h2>
    <p>View the <a href="javascript: tencorecommitments()" title="Pre-Paid Legal's 10 Core Commitments.">10 Core Commitments</a>; this is Legal Shield's guidance on how to be successful as an associate. What I recommend to be successful with Legal Shield as an Independent Associate is to do the following: Set up some good <span class="important_money">autoresponder e-mails</span> for when you get leads online. Start Advertising with a PPC company (if you can find a good one) because you can chose what States and Providences to advertise in. This being because certain States you need a license to sell Legal Plans and Not all Canadian Provinces offer a Legal Shield plan. Once you get leads online you will have to be <span class="important_money">good on the telephone</span> to sell the prospect on the membership and to follow-up with the prospect. Legal Shield does pay its Associates, see a <a href="javascript: prepaidlegalproof()" title="See a Pre-Paid Legal proof of payment I received.">Legal Shield payment proof</a>. </p><p><script type="text/javascript"><!--

    <h2>Know the product inside and out</h2>
    <p>Since there is a lot to know about the product, I would definitely recommend that you know the product really well so that you can answer your prospect's questions easily. Make sure you know who the plan covers and what it covers and vice versa.One of the first things you'll need to do once you become an Associate is to go through your warm market of family and friends you already know to introduce Legal Shield to them. Use this <a href="javascript: memoryjogger()" title="Legal Shield memory jogger to get your business started locally.">memory jogger</a> to help you remember everyone you know. If you need a <a href="javascript: prepaidlegalapplication()" title="Legal Shield membership application used to enroll new members to the service.">Legal Shield membership application</a> you can download this from your back office as well. Legal Shield gives you these applications for free. To download the application go to your back office and under Sales Assistance click on Docs on Demand. Click on Forms and towards the bottom you'll see the Universal Application. You kind of have to know a little bit about belly to belly sales. <span class="important_money">Books I recommend</span> getting that will teach you everything you need to know about sales are included below:</p><p align="center"><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/swflash.cab" id="Player_f49a0636-5c63-4d5d-b707-2226b2674aff"  WIDTH="600px" HEIGHT="200px"> <PARAM NAME="movie" VALUE="http://ws.amazon.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&MarketPlace=US&ID=V20070822%2FUS%2Fhttpwwwsignup-20%2F8010%2Ff49a0636-5c63-4d5d-b707-2226b2674aff&Operation=GetDisplayTemplate"><PARAM NAME="quality" VALUE="high"><PARAM NAME="bgcolor" VALUE="#FFFFFF"><PARAM NAME="allowscriptaccess" VALUE="always"><embed src="http://ws.amazon.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&MarketPlace=US&ID=V20070822%2FUS%2Fhttpwwwsignup-20%2F8010%2Ff49a0636-5c63-4d5d-b707-2226b2674aff&Operation=GetDisplayTemplate" id="Player_f49a0636-5c63-4d5d-b707-2226b2674aff" quality="high" bgcolor="#ffffff" name="Player_f49a0636-5c63-4d5d-b707-2226b2674aff" allowscriptaccess="always"  type="application/x-shockwave-flash" align="middle" height="200px" width="600px"></embed></OBJECT> <NOSCRIPT><A HREF="http://ws.amazon.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&MarketPlace=US&ID=V20070822%2FUS%2Fhttpwwwsignup-20%2F8010%2Ff49a0636-5c63-4d5d-b707-2226b2674aff&Operation=NoScript" target="_blank">Amazon.com Widgets</A>

    <h2>Overview on filling out a Legal Shield membership application</h2>
    <p>When you first get started it can be kind of tricky. If you subscribe to e-service and have a website where you can enroll members it's a lot easier and faster online. If you do not have e-service you'll have to fill out the <a href="javascript: prepaidlegalapplication()" title="Download a Legal Shield membership application here.">Legal Shield membership applications</a> manually. A few tips on this. The left hand side of the membership application is pretty straight forward. Just basic info. For the top right hand side you are going to want to check the first box, &quot;Pre-Paid Legal Services. Inc.&quot; Under that chose whether they want the Standard Family Plan ($17.00/mo.).</p>
    <p>If the future member want Identity Theft protection as well make sure to check that box. With the Legal Plan the basic Identity Theft plan adds an extra $9.95/mo to the total cost of the membership. For Associates Use Only, just fill out your Associate information and sign. Below that, make sure the member puts the City and State they are in as well as Dependents they may have and that they sign as well. Make sure to add the one-time enrollment fee of $10.00 and the total in the final box. The member will have to choose a payment option. Either Bank Draft or Debit/Credit Card. Most people do Debit/Credit card. Bank Draft is better because you don't have to worry about their credit card expiring. </p>
    <p>Make sure the member signs in the payment area. After that, just mail in the application to the proper address. If you are not sure what address to send the application to make sure to <a href="../../contact/" title="Contact Greg London about Legal Shield anytime.">contact me</a> and I will give you the correct address.</p>
    <h2>Take advantage of local trainings and meetings</h2>
    <p>I would also recommend taking advantage of a <span class="important_money">business briefing</span>, <span class="important_money">systems training</span>, or <span class="important_money">product training</span> in your local area. It doesn't matter where you are, their will definitely be a meeting near you! Another good thing about these meetings is that you can meet a lot of like minded people that could turn out to be friends forever! To find meetings and trainings in your area, log in to your <a href="http://www.legalshield.com" target="_blank">Legal Shield back office</a>. Then, go under Events on the left hand site and click on Training. Click on Training classes available for your State. To find meetings in your area, go under Events on the left hand side and click on Area Meetings. These are meetings you can invite people you know to take a look at <a href="http://coverthefamily.info/" target="_blank">Legal Shield</a>. There are also Luncheons and Breakfast Meetings you can choose to attend.</p>
    <p>There is also a lot of good <span class="important_money">training calls</span> online that are free to you as an associate. A couple of training materials I recommend you get are: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1890900451?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwsignup-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1890900451" target="_blank" title="Pathway to Platinum by Brian Mast.">Pathway to Platinum</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S5ZI68?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwsignup-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000S5ZI68" target="_blank" title="Power Training CDs by Jeff Olson.">Power Training with Jeff Olson (contains 3 CDs)</a>. To take advantage of free, pre-recorded trainig calls for Legal Shield, just log into your <a href="http://www.legalshield.com" target="_blank">back office</a>. Then, go down the right hand side and you'll see Recent Broadcasts.These are updated monthly. You can see what other Associates are doing in the business to succeed and copy them.</p>
    <h2>Legal Shield Autoresponders</h2>
    <p>I have written <a href="../advertising/pre-paid-legal-autoresponders.html" title="Legal Shield autoresponders to copy and paste that will help your new business out.">Legal Shield autoresponders for you to copy</a> that will help you succeed online with your Legal Shield business. Copy them into your own autoresponder system and change them around to make them your own.</p>
    <h2>Legal Shield phone script</h2>
    <p>So what do you say when you call a prospect? I like to keep things simple. I only deal with leads I get from PPC searches online that put their phone number into the lead form. This is my simple <span class="important">phone script</span>:</p>
    <p><span class="important_money">Hello, is &quot; &quot; available?</span> This is &quot; &quot;. <span class="important_money">My name is Greg London and I am an Independent Associate with Legal Shield. You were recently online and requested information about Legal Shield. I just wanted to make sure all your questions were answered properly if you have any.</span> Then the conversation will continue. It's that simple!</p>
    <p>This is why it is very important that you <span class="important_money">know the product you are selling</span>. You want to be able to explain to the prospect how Legal Shield can benefit them. Ask them good questions about their current situation. <span class="important_money">Be a good listener</span>. </p>
