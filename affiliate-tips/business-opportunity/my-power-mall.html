    <h2>How to be a success with My Power Mall</h2>
    <p>The coolest thing <a href="http://www.mypowermall.com/biz/home/90399" target="_blank">about My Power Mall</a> is that you never have to pay a membership fee if you don't want to. The only thing they ask of you to receive commissions is to simply <span class="important_money">buy just one thing a month</span>. This will keep your membership active and in good standing. They have <span class="important_money">over 1,100 stores to shop at</span> and you get cash back every time you buy something. So if you are going to buy something at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?%5Fencoding=UTF8&site-redirect=&node=163856011&tag=httpwwwsignup-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> anyway, why not buy it at your Power Mall instead and <a href="../../bonus/cash-back-shopping-sign-up-bonus-sites.html">get cash back</a> <span class="important_money">(from 2% to 55%)</span>. Plus when you refer people you get a percentage of their shopping habits as well. </p><p><script type="text/javascript"><!--
