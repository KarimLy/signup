<h1>Global Domains International Success</h1>
<img src="../../Assets/business-opportunity/global-domains-international-logo.jpg" alt="GDI or Global Domains International logo." title="GDI or Global Domains International." style="padding:left:25px;" hspace="15" align="right" width="313" height="55" />
      <p>With <a href="http://www.freedom.ws/signupandmakemoney" target="_blank" title="Global Domains International.">GDI</a> you definitely want to take advantage of the <span class="important_money">weekly bonuses</span>. How do you do that? You should <span class="important_money">offer an incentive for prospects to join</span> your GDI business. What I normally do is start off by telling all my prospects that they will receive a <span class="important_money">$10.00 signup bonus</span> at the end of their 7 day free trial through either <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/mrb/pal=L8HS43VDY5UMJ" target="_blank">Paypal</a> or <a href="http://www.alertpay.com/?vCJSzQ5RAlG1Mkl%2fpfKavw%3d%3d" target="_blank">Alertpay</a> (you can use other payment methods if the prospect doesn't use either of those two services). This gives the prospect <span class="important_money">37 days</span> to test drive GDI and it gives you 37 days to make sure they can trust you and know that you are their to help them succeed online. Concerning the weekly bonuses, if you get <span class="important_money">5 signups in a one week period</span>, GDI will give you a <span class="important_money">$100 bonus</span>. If you signup 10 people in a 1 week period, you'll receive a $200 bonus from GDI and so on and so on. Basically you will be <span class="important_money">giving away half of your weekly bonuses</span> to the people who sign up under you. This is a brilliant idea and is what all the top money earners in GDI are doing to be successful! <span class="comment"><a href="javascript: gdi()" title="See comments from others about GDI and add your own.">Comments on GDI</a>.</span></p>

    <p>If you are not comfortable giving away a $10.00 signup bonus to the prospects that sign up under you, GDI has another option for you to use. You can buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001078FFE?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwsignup-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001078FFE" target="_blank">GDI gift cards</a> for your prospect in your back office. The biggest downfall of this is that it is a slower process because you have to get the <span class="important_money">full name and e-mail address</span> of the prospect, then buy the gift card for them. GDI will then send the prospect the gift card which you already paid for (the <span class="important_money">minimum is $20.00</span> to do a gift card). You then have no guarantee whether or not the prospect will use the gift card and signup or not. The gift cards you buy can be transferred to another prospect if the first person you give one to doesn't sign up with it. Another downfall is that if you do get your 5 signups for the week and you gave all the people that signed up under the $20.00 gift card you will not make any money in bonuses. Instead you will just make the residual commissions. <span class="comment"><a href="javascript: gdiproof()" title="See a proof of payment I received from Global Domains International.">GDI proof of payment</a>.</span></p>
      <p>You can also do what I do. I no longer offer the $10 signup  bonus (except for special promotions) and focus my efforts on explaining to the prospect the <span class="important_money">benefit of owning your own website</span>. You will find that this works over and over again. It will also incur a long term relationship between you and your referral! To <span class="important_money">get over 1 million visitors to your GDI affiliate link</span>, just visit my <a href="../../traffic/">marketing page</a> now.</p>
    <h2>GDI Autoresponders</h2>
      <p>Concerning <span class="important_money">autoresponders</span>, <a href="../advertising/gdi-autoresponders.html" title="Copy and paste pre-written autoresponder e-mails to help you promote GDI.">copy and paste pre-written autoresponders for GDI</a> into your own autoresponder. You can change the pre-written e-mails anyway you want. These are just a starting point for you to be successful online. I composed these autoresponders myself, so just <span class="important_money">remove my affiliate info</span> and put in your own. Their are <span class="important_money">10</span> pre-written e-mails. You can add more if you would like. Having an e-mail campaign set up for your <a href="http://www.freedom.ws/signupandmakemoney" target="_blank">GDI business</a> is a must and will help <span class="important_money">automate</span> your sales online. </p>
    <h2>How to log into GDI</h2>
    <p>Just to make sure their is no confusion, the url to log into your back office for GDI is <a href="http://www.website.ws" target="_blank" title="Log into your GDI back office.">www.website.ws</a> Your user name is the actual name of your website. Just like my user name is <span class="important_money">signupandmakemoney</span>, so my website domain is <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.ws/" target="_blank" title="Greg London's GDI website.">www.signupandmakemoney.ws</a>.</p>
    <h2>GDI links</h2>
    <p>Another thing I would like to cover with GDI is all the different links you can use to advertise your business that have different themes. Here are the links you can chose from, pick the ones you like best:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.website.ws/signupandmakemoney" target="_blank" title="This GDI theme lists a bunch of testimonials.">www.website.ws</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.freedom.ws/signupandmakemoney" target="_blank" title="This GDI theme has a movie presentation on it.">www.freedom.ws</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.money.ws/signupandmakemoney" target="_blank" title="This GDI theme starts off with a car driving fast with a short opt-in page.">www.money.ws</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.movie.ws/signupandmakemoney" target="_blank" title="This GDI theme prompts for a name and e-mail address in order to watch the GDI movie.">www.movie.ws</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Another thing to keep in mind is that GDI will only keep hit statistics on the <a href="http://www.website.ws/signupandmakemoney" target="_blank" title="URL that GDI will keep track of hits on.">www.website.ws</a> link if you are interested in that. Remember to put your referral link on all of these sites. For example: <span class="important_money">website.ws</span> should be <a href="http://www.website.ws/signupandmakemoney" target="_blank" title="Greg London's GDI affiliate link as an example.">www.website.ws/signupandmakemoney</a>. </p>
    <h2>Setting up your e-mail account with GDI</h2>
    <p>With GDI you get <span class="important_money">10 different e-mail accounts</span>. To set them up all you have to do is log into your back office. You might want to use a few of your 10 e-mail accounts. For example, I would recommend making one that is for information. Like: <a href="mailto:info@signupandmakemoney.ws" title="Using a generic info as your GDI e-mail address.">info@signupandmakemoney.ws</a>. Your main name: <a href="mailto:greg@signupandmakemoney.ws" title="Using your name with your GDI e-mail address.">greg@signupandmakemoney.ws</a>. You might want another e-mail address for webmaster questions: <a href="mailto:webmaster@signupandmakemoney.ws" title="An example webmaster GDI e-mail address.">webmaster@signupandmakemoney.ws</a>.</p>
    <h2>GDI Invite Filler</h2>
    <p>I don't use <a href="http://www.gdi-invite-filler.ws/" target="_blank" title="The GDI Invite Filler is a tool some GDI affiliates use to promote GDI.">GDI Invite Filler</a>, but some have found it a good way to take advantage of the invite tool when you log into your back office. Use at your own risk.</p>
    <h2>GDI educational sites</h2>
    <p>I've also found a website that I am not affiliated with that can be of good help to you. This site was created by another GDI affiliate. It has some good training on it: <a href="http://www.gdi-made-easy.ws/" target="_blank" title="GDI Made Easy.">www.gdi-made-easy.ws</a>. </p>
    <p>I also found sites that are free and will help you build your GDI business and downlines. The Spider Web System will build a website and Blog for you using your GDI domain name you used when you signed up: </p>
    <ul><li><a href="http://www.payitforward4profits.com/gdc25" target="_blank" title="Pay it Forward 4 Profits.">www.payitforward4profits.com</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.grinteam.com/?3389/" target="_blank" title="Grin Team.">www.grinteam.com</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.hits2u.com/?230388" target="_blank" title="Hits 2 U.">www.hits2u.com</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.gdiincometeam.com/?1171" target="_blank" title="GDI Income Team.">www.gdiincometeam.com</a></li> <li><a href="http://networkstarteam.net/?gdc25" target="_blank" title="Network Star Team.">www.networkstarteam.net</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.theSpiderWebSystem.com/signupandmakemoney" target="_blank" title="The Spider Web System.">www.thespiderwebsystem.com</a> (<span class="comment"><a href="javascript: spiderweb()" title="See comments from others about The Spiderweb Marketing System and add your own.">Comments on The Spider Web Marketing System</a>.</span>)</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>You can also log into your back office at: <a href="http://www.website.ws" target="_blank">www.website.ws </a>and get access to the <span class="important_money">GDI forum</span>. There is a lot of good information on the forum. Another site that will <a href="../../traffic/">advertise your GDI affiliate link</a> to over 500,000 members and growing is <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/blog/2009/01/clixsense-as-an-advertising-option-online/" title="Join Clixsense for free and promote your GDI affiliate link.">ClixSense</a>. For just <span class="important_money">$5.00/mo</span> you can get a lot of leads and signups using their services.</p>
    <h2>GDI phone script</h2>
    <p>So what do you say when you call a prospect? I get all my leads from <a href="http://www.signupandmakemoney.com/">www.signupandmakemoney.com</a>, they visit my site and click on the banners I have displayed on the site. They then fill in their name and e-mail address and some of the prospects will fill in their phone number as well. Only if the prospect has a <span class="important_money">United States</span> phone number will I attempt to call them. It just gets too expensive to try and call international prospects, plus the language barrier doesn't help either. This is my lead in <span class="important_money">phone script</span> for calling a GDI prospect:</p>
    <p><span class="important_money">Hello, is &quot; &quot; available?</span> This is &quot; &quot;. <span class="important_money">Hi my name is Greg London and you recently visited my Global Domains International website. I just wanted to make sure you had all your questions answered. Are you interested in the business opportunity or in making your own website? If you sign up on my team I will help you design your site and pay you $10 after your 7 day trial so you'll have 37 days to try GDI out. How does this sound to you?</span> Then the conversation will continue.</p>
    <p>That's pretty much it. Remember that it is very important to <span class="important_money">know your product inside and out</span> so you can convince the prospect why using GDI would be better than using anything else. Also don't forget to <span class="important_money">ask questions</span>. Be a <span class="important_money">good listener</span>! Also remember that it is very important to be shooting for <span class="important_money">5 signups a week</span> or else paying the prospect $10 to sign up ends up being very expensive!</p>
