<p>Here are the <a href="../blog/tag/survey-companies/">best survey sites</a> for you  to sign up on and they are all <span class="important_money">FREE</span> and pay you for your time! Most surveys pay anywhere from $1.00 up to $10.00 a survey on average. Unfortunately, you'll have to qualify for each survey you take. Even if you don't qualify you can still be entered into their latest drawing or sweepstakes and win anywhere from $10.00 up to $1,000 just for being active.</p>

<p>Don't fall for survey scams that claim they'll pay you $75.00 plus for taking surveys online. The only way they would pay that much is if you were participating in a very lengthly survey or had to leave your home to attend a product sampling in person.</p>

<p>Make sure to download <a href="http://www.roboform.com/php/land.php?affid=gdc25&amp;frm=frame4" target="_blank" title="Roboform.">RoboForm</a>, this will make it very easy to register with all the sites!</p>
