<h1>Paid to Click Sites</h1>

<img src="../Assets/signup-bonus/get-paid-to-click.jpg" alt="A dollar sign mouse in place of c on the word click." title="A dollar sign mouse in place of c on the word click." style="padding-left:15px;" align="right" width="200" height="163" />

<p>With these paid to click sites you can make a lot of money just by <a href="../blog/tag/paid-to-click/">clicking on ads</a>. It's really that simple! Most of these sites pay 1 cent for your clicks and 1 cent for your referral's clicks. Once again, they are all free to sign up on and you can advertise on them as well, so take advantage of all of them.</p>

<p>I don't recommed upgrading in any of them, plus it wouldn't be profitable on your end to purchase any kind of referrals from the paid to click sites. Just use their free services. </p>

<p>Make sure to download <a href="http://www.roboform.com/php/land.php?affid=gdc25&amp;frm=frame4" target="_blank" title="Roboform.">RoboForm</a>, this will make it very easy to register with all the sites!</p>
